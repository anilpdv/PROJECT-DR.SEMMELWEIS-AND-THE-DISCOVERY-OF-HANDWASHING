# PROJECT-DR.SEMMELWEIS-AND-THE-DISCOVERY-OF-HANDWASHING
This project about confirming the that childbed fever is caused by the unclean hands of the doctors , due to the childbed fever 
10% of the women giving birth are died from it. He is thinking because he know it but no one believed it . we can see there is 
significant of change from the invention of the semmelweis theory that doctors who are working on the mortuary are also working 
on the child delivery due to this,after they work on the mortuary they skip to wash hand so the bacteria that believed to be belong
to the mortuary is cause of the childbed fever. Semmelweis noticed that by dividing the data in to two seprarate clinics where one
is operating from two sides.
